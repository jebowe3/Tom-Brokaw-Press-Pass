Nixon’s nomination would mark his fifth from the RNC. His appearance on the national ticket ties FDR for most; the two would be on the voting ticket in both vice presidential and presidential capacities. Agnew would end up resigning in 1973 from scandal and replacing him would be Gerald Ford. Following his role as the 40th vice president of the United States, Ford would become president of the United States following Nixon’s resignation as a result of Watergate. Ford is the only person to hold both offices without ever being elected by the Electoral College.<br><br><iframe style='display: block; margin: auto;' width='580' height='325' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SE8QdCAUFug'></iframe>"

The Xenia tornado caused over $100 million in damage. <br> <br> Nixon would visit Xenia and deliver remarks at a site of the devastation: a school. Xenia was hit the hardest, and this moment is still considered one of the most devastating natural disasters in American history. <br> <br> Xenia would be the site of a second damaging tornado.
